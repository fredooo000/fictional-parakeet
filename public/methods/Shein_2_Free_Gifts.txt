# **How to do the SHEIN Method 2 free gifts**

1. **Delete SHEIN** – If you already have the SHEIN app downloaded and an account, delete the app first.

2. **Reinstall SHEIN** – Download the SHEIN app again, but **don’t open it yet**.

3. **Use the Link** – Go to Discord and find the one-time link I sent you from <@1326600322470121535> .

4. **Make a New Account** – After tapping the link, create a **brand-new SHEIN account**. (This step is important — it won’t work otherwise.)

5. **Watch for the Animation** – Once you see the high-five animation, **close the SHEIN app completely**.

6. **Reopen SHEIN** – Open the SHEIN app again, then tap **“Me”** at the bottom.

7. **Scroll Down** – Scroll down a bit until you see the reward/offer section on the image on this message — **tap it**.
